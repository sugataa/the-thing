# The thing

The scariest text adventure you'll ever play.

## About

In remote Antarctica, a group of American research scientists are disturbed
at their base camp by a helicopter shooting at a sled dog. When they take in
the dog, it brutally attacks both human beings and canines in the camp and
they discover that the beast can assume the shape of its victims. A resourceful
helicopter pilot (Kurt Russell) and the camp doctor (Richard Dysart) lead the
camp crew in a desperate, gory battle against the vicious creature before it
picks them all off, one by one.
